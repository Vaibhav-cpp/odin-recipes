# About the Project
The current project is for learning basic git and github along with ways to commit.
The project is build on HTML and it is part of practice for me to implement it on github using git commands from local system.

# Learnings
1) At the end of the project i would be able to use HTML for structuring a webpage.
2) I would be able to use git commands for pushing files from local system into GitHub profile.
3) I would pass required commit messages for the project.
